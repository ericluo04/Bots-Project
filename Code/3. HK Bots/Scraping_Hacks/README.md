# Scrapping_hacks
This repository aims at providing some tools and practices from scraping or crawling data. It contains three scripts :

- bot_script.py
- twitter_friends_graph_script.py
- ioHELPER.py

The bot_script.py aims at querying Botometer API to get bot scores of Twitter accounts (see the README for more details)

The twitter_friends_graph_script.py script aims at building the friends graph of a given set of users, without going through the API which is very restrictive in number of queries per day (see the README for more details). 

The ioHELPER.py script contains methods to read/write csv files.
